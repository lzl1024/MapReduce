DR. DILLON TO EDWARD DELANEY, ESQ., AT THE PINES. NEAR RYE, N.H.

August 8, 1872.

My Dear Sir: I am happy to assure you that your anxiety is without reason. 
Flemming will be confined to the sofa for three or four weeks, 
and will have to be careful at first how he uses his leg. 
A fracture of this kind is always a tedious affair. 
Fortunately the bone was very skilfully set by the surgeon who chanced to 
be in the drugstore where Flemming was brought after his fall, and I apprehend 
no permanent inconvenience from the accident. Flemming is doing perfectly well 
physically; but I must confess that the irritable and morbid state of mind into 
which he has fallen causes me a great deal of uneasiness. He is the last man in 
the world who ought to break his leg. You know how impetuous our friend is 
ordinarily, what a soul of restlessness and energy, never content unless 
he is rushing at some object, like a sportive bull at a red shawl; but amiable 
withal. He is no longer amiable. His temper has become something frightful. Miss 
Fanny Flemming came up from Newport, where the family are staying for the summer, 
to nurse him; but he packed her off the next morning in tears. He has a complete 
set of Balzac's works, twenty-seven volumes, piled up near his sofa, to throw at 
Watkins whenever that exemplary serving-man appears with his meals. Yesterday I 
very innocently brought Flemming a small basket of lemons. You know it was a strip 
of lemonpeel on the curbstone that caused our friend's mischance. Well, he no sooner 
set is eyes upon those lemons than he fell into such a rage as I cannot adequately 
describe. This is only one of moods, and the least distressing. At other times he 
sits with bowed head regarding his splintered limb, silent, sullen, despairing. 
When this fit is on him--and it sometimes lasts all day--nothing can distract his 
melancholy. He refuses to eat, does not even read the newspapers; books, except as 
projectiles for Watkins, have no charms for him. His state is truly pitiable.

Now, if he were a poor man, with a family depending on his daily labor, this irritability 
and despondency would be natural enough. But in a young fellow of twenty-four, with plenty 
of money and seemingly not a care in the world, the thing is monstrous. If he continues 
to give way to his vagaries in this manner, he will end by bringing on an inflammation of 
the fibula. It was the fibula he broke. I am at my wits' end to know what to prescribe 
for him. I have anaesthetics and lotions, to make people sleep and to soothe pain; but 
I've no medicine that will make a man have a little common-sense. That is beyond my skill,
but maybe it is not beyond yours. You are Flemming's intimate friend, his fidus Achates. 
Write to him, write to him frequently, distract his mind, cheer him up, and prevent him 
from becoming a confirmed case of melancholia. Perhaps he has some important plans 
disarranged by his present confinement. If he has you will know, and will know how to advise
 him judiciously. I trust your father finds the change beneficial? I am, my dear sir, 
with great respect, etc.
